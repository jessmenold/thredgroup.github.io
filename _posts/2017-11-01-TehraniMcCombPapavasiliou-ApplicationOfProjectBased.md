This paper outlines a project-based learning approach to engineering education. This approach directly employs sustainable development as a vehicle to prepare students for global engineering challenges. The theoretical concept of the presented work utilizes the extended situational teaching model. This model explains the role of the teacher-leader in engineering classroom to help students with gaining essential elements of engineering education, including superior knowledge, reliable skills, and professional attitude. Case studies and examples of experiential learning projects demonstrate the development of links between classroom teaching, research advising, laboratory works, and field projects, including both domestic and international projects.
